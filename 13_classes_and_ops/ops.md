# JavaScript Classes
Yes, JavaScript does have classes. The class syntax was introduced in ECMAScript 2015 (ES6) to make it easier to create and work with constructor functions and prototypes, providing a more object-oriented programming (OOP) approach.
This class syntax is essentially syntactic sugar over the existing prototype-based inheritance in JavaScript. Under the hood, the class keyword is just a more convenient way to define constructor functions and their prototypes.   

## OOP  (Programming paradigm) 
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowerCase

## why use oop

## parts of oop
object literal

- Constructor function
- prototypes
- Classes
- Instances(new, this)

## 4 pillars
- Abstraction (fetch)
- Encapsulation (wrap up data)
- Inheritance
- Polymorphism (many forms) eg=>console.log()
