# Fetch()
```
The fetch() method takes one mandatory argument, the path to the resource you want to fetch. 
It returns a Promise that resolves to the Response to that request — as soon as the server 
responds with headers — even if the server response is an HTTP error status. You can also 
optionally pass in an init options object as the second argument 
```
